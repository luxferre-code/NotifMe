# ðŸ“… | NotifMe

> NotifMe is a Python script that allows you to automate sending your calendar to your devices. It is very user-friendly and does not require much computing power. A simple internet connection is all that is needed to run the program.  

## Prerequisites

To use NotifMe, you will need to install:

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PushBullet ](https://www.pushbullet.com/)
- Pip (if not installed by default with Python)  
  
For the use of Cron tasks, I recommend that you have a server running **Debian or Ubuntu**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luxferre-code/NotifMe.git
